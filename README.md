<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Rocket-Elevators-Foundation is the 9th week for the Odyssey 14 weeks program in CodeBoxx. 

By the 4th week We have created a CRUD website using a using Ruby on Rails with the website created in the Genesis Program. 

website used: [rocketlift.ca/](https://rocketlift.ca/)

We have also included a MySql Database that saves the quotations inserted in the quote form, and an Admin page.

##

For the 5th week, we have included a Data Warehouse with Postgres where has taken the subimitted quotes and contact forms info and through some queries
the Admin was able to analyse those data.

<br>

We have 7 API on the project

- **[Maps JavaScript API]**
- **[Twillo]**
- **[Zendesk]**
- **[Sengrid]**
- **[IBM Watson]**
- **[Dropbox]**
- **[Slack]**

If you want to test Dropbox, you have to create a customer (from backoffice) and a lead (from the index page) with the same phone number and email and go on the Admin_Stats page to trigger Dropbox.

If you want to test google maps, wait for it to finish loading, even if the browser isn't loading anymore.

In the 9th week I have done:

## Website deployed

* ### [takhleet.ca/](https://takhleet.ca/)

<br>

## Created End points for Rest API's 

## Created the tables
- Scaffold
-  rails db:migrate reset
- rails db:seed


## Accessing

By clicking on “Login”, users will be redirected to a page and be asked to provide an email address and password.
	
	Example: 

	Email: nicolas.genest@codeboxx.biz
	Password: password

Forms are accessible to all users (with or without accounts). Once a “Contact Us” part for home page or Quote form in request a quote page is filled and submitted, data is generated in the back-end.

<br>

To access the database, use Dbeaver or MySQLWorkbench, which shows a history of data stored in the server. The fictitious and real data covers the last 3 years of activity from companies. Graphical representations and charts will also be available in the stats page of the website.
